This project was generated using OpenStreetMap Data, Google Places API, and a number of manufacturing supplier resources. 

We first input Novelis locations in the project folder as JSON data.

We downloaded the OSM file for the entire US and preprocessed this data with a command-line tool called osmium to extract only rail spurs within a certain radius of the Novelis locations listed.
